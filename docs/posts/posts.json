Where I can import and export data with ease between MySQL and python and r. This blog is an example on how to connect to all these tools easily and simply.\nTo connect to your local instance of MySQL, you will need to install and use the RMySQL and DBI libraries.\n\n\n#install.packages(\"RMySQL\")\nlibrary(RMySQL)\nlibrary(DBI)\n\n\n\nTo connect to user = root or replace root with your username. For your password it’s a good idea to tuck it away in your $home directory in a file called .my.cnf and define a group called “clients”\nUsing bash - This is what my file looks like:\n\n\ncat -n /Users/eileen/.my.cnf\n     1  [client]\n     2  # The following password is sent to all standard MySQL clients\n     3  password=\"Meadow4085!\"\n\nThen use the client group to mask your password and remember to change user, if you don’t use root.\n\n\ncon <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(),\n                 host = \"127.0.0.1\",\n                 port = 3306, \n                 user = \"root\",\n                 group = 'client'\n                 )\n\n\n\nThe connection is saved in the con variable that makes it easy to retrieve, if you have any problems or just want to make sure that you are connected.\n\n\nsummary(con)\n\n\n<MySQLConnection:0,0>\n  User:   root \n  Host:   127.0.0.1 \n  Dbname:  \n  Connection type: 127.0.0.1 via TCP/IP \n\nResults:\n\nNow you can execute the MySQL commands directly. Make sure that you are in the sql chunk and your connection = “con”.\n\n\nshow databases;\n\nTable 1: 6 records\nDatabase\ninformation_schema\nmysql\nperformance_schema\nRyersonDB\nRyersondDB\nsys\n\n\nDon’t forget to close your connection, when you are finished.\n\n\ndbDisconnect(con)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nFor python, we need to install the reticulate package.\n\n\nlibrary(reticulate, quietly = T)\n#suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(\"reticulate\"))\noptions(reticulate.repl.quiet = TRUE)\nuse_virtualenv(\"r-reticulate\")\n#use_python(\"/usr/local/bin/python3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n#execute find python3 or where (on windows)\n# in the terminal\nuse_python(\"/usr/local/bin/python3\")\n\n\n\n\nprint(\"hello ok\")\nhello ok\n\n\n\n\n",
