Here is a way, to compare your versions with what this article was compiled on.\n\n\ncurrentdate <- Sys.Date()\nlibrary(\"utils\")\nlibrary(\"rstudioapi\")\nRStudio_info <- rstudioapi::versionInfo()\npaste(\"Updated on:\" ,currentdate, \"Using: \", R.version.string,\n      \"and RStudio version: \", RStudio_info$version)\n\n\n[1] \"Updated on: 2022-05-31 Using:  R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10) and RStudio version:  1.4.1725\"\n\nOne of my wonderful discoveries in RStudio is being able to connect to the various tools sets that I would not only use but to have it all in one place. Where I can import and export data with ease between MySQL and python and r. This blog is an example on how to connect to all these tools easily and simply.\nTo connect to your local instance of MySQL, you will need to install and use the RMySQL and DBI libraries.\n\n\n#install.packages(\"RMySQL\")\nlibrary(RMySQL)\nlibrary(DBI)\n\n\n\nTo connect to user = root or replace root with your username. For your password it’s a good idea to tuck it away in your $home directory in a file called .my.cnf and define a group called “clients”\nUsing bash - This is what my file looks like:\n\ncat -n /Users/eileen/.my.cnf\n     1  [client]\n     2  # The following password is sent to all standard MySQL clients\n     3  password=\"EnterYourPassword\"\n     4  \n     5  [mysqld] \n     6  local-infile \n\nThen use the client group to mask your password and remember to change user, if you don’t use root.\n\n\ncon <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(),\n                 host = \"127.0.0.1\",\n                 port = 3306, \n                 user = \"root\",\n                 group = 'client'\n                 )\n\n\n\nThe connection is saved in the con variable that makes it easy to retrieve, if you have any problems or just want to make sure that you are connected.\n\nuse godata;\n\n\n\nsummary(con)\n\n\n<MySQLConnection:0,0>\n  User:   root \n  Host:   127.0.0.1 \n  Dbname: godata \n  Connection type: 127.0.0.1 via TCP/IP \n\nResults:\n\nNow you can execute the MySQL commands directly. Make sure that you are in the sql chunk and your connection = “con”.\n\nshow databases;\n\nTable 1: 6 records\nDatabase\ngodata\ninformation_schema\nmysql\nperformance_schema\nsample\nsys\n\n\nDon’t forget to close your connection, when you are finished.\n\n\ndbDisconnect(con)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nFor python, we need to install the reticulate package.\n\n\nlibrary(reticulate, quietly = T)\noptions(reticulate.repl.quiet = TRUE)\nuse_virtualenv(\"r-reticulate\")\n#use_python(\"/usr/local/bin/python3\")\n\n\n\nUse the python version you are using by typing “find python” on the mac or where python in windows using a terminal session.\n\n\n#execute find python3 or where (on windows)\n# in the terminal\n#use_python(\"/Users/Eileen/opt/anaconda3/bin/python\")\nuse_python(\"/usr/local/bin/python3.9\")\n\n\n\nIf you notice that python is not printing in the for loop after printing outside of it - then use the flush = True in the print statement before the loop.\n\n#Test python program\n\nstatement = \"Python is a powerful language that can be used in Rstudio\"\nprint(statement)\nPython is a powerful language that can be used in Rstudio\nstatementList = statement.split(sep=\" \")\nprint(statementList, flush=True)\n['Python', 'is', 'a', 'powerful', 'language', 'that', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'in', 'Rstudio']\nfor iCounter in range(len(statementList)):\n  print(statementList[iCounter])\nPython\nis\na\npowerful\nlanguage\nthat\ncan\nbe\nused\nin\nRstudio\n\nAcknowledgments\nRStudio Team (2021).
